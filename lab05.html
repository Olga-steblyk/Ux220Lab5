        <p> As I was exploring different songs from different decades, the one I was most intrested would be the 80s, but especially the more so rock and post rock world. Bands such as 'Talking Heads', 'New Order', and even 'The Smiths', additioanlly bands that my parents grew up with in languges that they understand, a popular one being "Kino".</p>
        <br />
        <p>But the one song I can't ever get out of my head would be "Losing my Religion" by R.E.M.. </p>
